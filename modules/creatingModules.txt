# module is a file that contains some python code
# modules should contain higly related object fx. in a supermarrket, no cleaning supplies in the fruit section
#these objects can be functions, classes, variables etc.

# how to import

 from nameOfModule/file(without py) and from sales we import(after writing import click ctr+space and 
 you will see all the objects defined in the module )
so if we have a file called sales.py containing functions called calc_shipping, the import will be:

from sales import calc_shipping

and then we can just call it like normal function, like this: calc_shipping()

if you want to import mutliple objects from a module, you can seperate them using a comma 

using asterix is bad coding bc you can several differents functions or variables and if you blindly import them
into the currentl module. some of the objects may be overwrite some objects with the same name in the current module

another way to import:

import sales

and then you can use dot-notation to acces it's members, which will look like this: sales.calc_shipping()
